Information on data post-processing codes:


"flowInformation.py" takes a folder with VTK masks or MAT files, reads all files and saves flow information
on them in a specified folder as TXT files. Alternatively, it can also load the flow information previously
saved in those TXT files to use it for later purposes.

To run from terminal: folder_with_mask/MAT_file/TXT_file destination_folder (unused for loading)
			folder_with_phase_images flag('save' or 'load') energy_to_save (only to load info from MAT files)

Requires to have installed: NumPy, Scipy, VTK


"flowStatistics.py" contains a collection of functions useful for a statistical analysis of flow results 
coming from the neural network segmentations, comparing them to the reference values extracted from Segment software.
Functions have to be executed in an external .py file. The functions contained are:

- t_test: completes a T test. Inputs: result measures and reference measures. Outputs: t statistic and p value

- wilcoxon_test: completes a Wilcoxon test. Inputs: result measures and reference measures. Outputs: sum of rank differences
and p value

- linear_regression_test: computes linear regression between resulting and reference measures. Inputs: result measures,
reference measures, flag to plot results, flag to save plot as PNG, directory where to save plot as PNG (if save = True) and
filename for PNG (if save == True). Outputs: linear regression coefficients, Mean Squared Error and R2 coefficient

- bland_altman_plot: computes a Bland-Altman plot from the resulting and reference measures. Inputs: result measures, 
reference_measures, flag to save results as PNG files, directory where to save plot as PNG (if save = True) and
filename for PNG (if save == True)

- figure_saving: function to save Matplotlib figures. Inputs: destination folder, filename (.png) and Matplotlib figure.
If one wants to save a linear regression plot or a Bland-Altman plot, this function MUST be imported, too

Requires to have installed: Scipy (for t test and Wilcoxon test), Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (for linear regression) and 
			    Statsmodels (for Bland-Altman plot)
